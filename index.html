            <div class="project-description">
                <p > Fungal contamination of soft cheeses, such as feta, poses a significant problem for organic 
                    cheese farms. This results in major economic losses, potential health hazards from fungal 
                    mycotoxins, and quality reduction due to unnatural odors and flavors. This project focuses 
                    on inhibiting the growth of Penicillium commune, a common cause of cheese spoilage, on feta 
                    cheese through recombinant chitinase expression in Lactococcus lactis and exploring its 
                    industrial applications. My team in iGEM at UC Berkeley is currently working on 
                    constructing and transforming shuttle vectors containing our chitinase gene of interest 
                    into L. lactis, refining a secretion signaling system, and developing assays that will 
                    determine the antifungal activities of our engineered chassis.</p>

            <div class="project-description">
                <p> This research study with the Dean Lab at UCSF analyzed over 800 publicly available Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) genomes 
                    collected from across global sub-continents to identify the Ct lineage-specific biological function
                    and deduce virulence. For the first time, Ct genomes was curated and assembled using a 
                    newly-developed nextflow based pipeline called Bactopia. The assembled genomes was used to 
                    create whole genome phylogenies and identify patterns of recombination and single nucleotide 
                    polymorphisms (SNPs) across the Ct lineages. Fine-detailed comparative genomics will be performed
                    to identify genomic strain types and genes involved in genetic variation, driving selection, virulence 
                    and tissue tropism and their impact on chlamydial pathogenesis.

            <div class="project-description">    
                <p> iPSCs hold promising potential for autologous stem cell-based therapies, however, there are drawbacks of iPSCs
                    to be used for therapeutic purposes, including its causation for teratoma formation and immune rejection. By 
                    partially reprogramming cells through cyclic activation of OSKM by a tet-inducible system, transient 
                    immunogenicity, or the ability of cells and/or tissues to provoke an immune response over a short 
                    period of time, can be studied, and its impact can pave the way for the viability of partially reprogrammed 
                    cells in clinical applications. </p>
